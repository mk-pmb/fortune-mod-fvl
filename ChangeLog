  mkfortune handles more idiosyncrasies (at.linux is chaotic)

  i.e. /^$/. Lines starting with white space, .i.e /\s+/ are ignored.

2002-06-08
==========

  3cc32961@fefe.d => 3cc32961@fefe.de
  3cd54204@fefe.de was one line too short

- html.sed can handle complete fortune files, not just a single cookie

- rewrote Makefile with implicit rules to easily handle more than one
  fortune file, new rule to generate .html from complete file

- fvl_vendor.id is a summary from fvl.id regarding vendors and products

- 347 fortunes total
